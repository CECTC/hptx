# hptx
High-performance non-intrusive distributed transaction solution, inspired by kubernetes, only for golang language.

___
## Features
+ High-performance and non-intrusive
+ Support AT mode And TCC mode
+ Support check global lock in local transaction

## Requirements
+ Go 1.16 or higher.
+ ETCD(3+)
+ AT mode: Mysql (5.7+), MariaDB

___
## Installation
Simple install the package to your $GOPATH with the go tool from shell:
```shell
$ go get -u github.com/cectc/hptx
```
If you use AT mode to solve distributed transaction problems, you should also install the following packageï¼š
```shell
$ go get -u github.com/cectc/mysql
```
Make sure [Git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine and in your system's PATH.

## Usage
You should have your ETCD ready first. then, you can initialize hptx via `hptx.InitFromFile`:
```go
import (
    "github.com/cectc/hptx"
	"github.com/cectc/hptx/pkg/config"
	"github.com/cectc/hptx/pkg/resource"
	"github.com/cectc/mysql"
)
  
//...

hptx.InitFromFile("${path of your config file}")
// If you use at mode, initial with following code 
mysql.RegisterResource(config.GetATConfig().DSN)
resource.InitATBranchResource(mysql.GetDataSourceManager())
```
It is also possible to set the configuration directly:
```go
import (
    "github.com/cectc/hptx"
	"github.com/cectc/hptx/pkg/config"
	"github.com/cectc/hptx/pkg/resource"
	"github.com/cectc/mysql"
)
  
//...

// Fill in the fields as needed.
hptx.InitWithConf(&config.DistributedTransaction{
    ApplicationID:                    "",
    RetryDeadThreshold:               0,
    RollbackRetryTimeoutUnlockEnable: false,
    EtcdConfig:                       clientv3.Config{},
    ATConfig:                         config.ATConfig{},
    TMConfig:                         config.TMConfig{},
})
// If you use at mode, initial with following code 
mysql.RegisterResource(config.GetATConfig().DSN)
resource.InitATBranchResource(mysql.GetDataSourceManager())
```
